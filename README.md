## Easy Setup Guide üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Install Tools (First Time Only)
1. [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Add board support:
   - **ESP32**: `https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json`
   - **ESP8266**: `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`
   
   *(File > Preferences > Additional Boards URLs)*

### 2. Copy the Code üìù
  - Open the *.ino file for your board in the Arduino IDE

### 3. Configuration üîß
   ```cpp
   // WiFi Credentials
   #define WIFI_SSID "Your_WiFi_SSID"
   #define WIFI_PASSWORD "Your_WiFi_Password"
   
   // NTP Configuration (GMT+1 with DST)
   configTime(3600, 3600, "pool.ntp.org");
```


### 4. Usage
1. Connect to serial monitor (115200 baud)  
2. Wait for IP address confirmation  
3. Access in browser: `http://[ESP-IP]`

   
### 5. Use the following routes
- http://[ESP-IP]/         ‚Üí Redirects to /main (if index.html exists)
- http://[ESP-IP]/fs       ‚Üí File Manager UI
- http://[ESP-IP]/reset    ‚Üí Restart the ESP
